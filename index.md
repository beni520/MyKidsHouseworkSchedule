![Image](icon-1024.png)


In the process of children's growth, parents and families have a great influence on their children's practical ability and consciousness. For example, when the child is free, or on weekends, arrange appropriate housework for the child, such as cleaning the table, sweeping the floor, etc. Appropriate amount of housework for children can cultivate their ability of self-care and hands-on. You can record the details of the tools and contents to be prepared in the child's housework schedule, as well as the completed and unfinished housework. You can organize this information into a list to help children develop good self-care ability.


If you have any questions, you can either leave a message or send the questions to our email address.

We will answer them for you in the first time.
